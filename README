lfswsrelay.js
=============
A small set of scripts to wrap and deal with the LFSWorld websocket InSim relay.

Requires a web browser supporting WebSockets.
See examples/ for example usage.
examples/simple/ for a basic implementation.
examples/angular/ for a more complex angular.js based implementation.

Not all packets currently implemented.
Higher level API currently not implemented, this means that you kind of need to
know the essentials of InSim and the Relay.

  * nodejs' events.EventEmitter and util.inherits - https://github.com/joyent/node/

Dependencies not bundled (see examples for inclusion(s))
